[00:01] TWO AUGUSTS AGO
[00:03] I TOLD THE TRUTH, OH, BUT YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT, YOU WENT HOME
[00:10] YOU'RE IN YOUR BENZ, I'M BY THE GATE
[00:14] [Instrumental]
[00:18] NOW YOU GO ALONE
[00:20] CHARM ALL THE PEOPLE YOU TRAIN FOR, YOU MEAN WELL BUT AIM LOW
[00:26] AND I'LL MAKE IT KNOWN LIKE I'M GETTING PAID
[00:33] THAT'S JUST THE WAY LIFE GOES
[00:36] I LIKE TO SLAM DOORS CLOSED
[00:41] TRUST ME, I KNOW IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT ME
[00:48] I LOVE YOU, I'M SORRY
[00:51] TWO SUMMERS FROM NOW
[00:53] WE'LL HAVE BEEN TALKING
[00:55] BUT NOT ALL THAT OFTEN, WE'RE COOL NOW
[00:59] I'LL BE ON A BOAT
[01:01] YOU'RE ON A PLANE
[01:04] GOING SOMEWHERE, SAME
[01:07] AND I'LL HAVE A DRINK
[01:10] WISTFULLY LEAN OUT MY WINDOW AND WATCH THE SUN SET ON THE LAKE
[01:16] I MIGHT NOT FEEL REAL
[01:18] BUT IT'S OKAY, MM
[01:22] 'CAUSE THAT'S JUST THE WAY LIFE GOES
[01:26] I PUSH MY LUCK, IT SHOWS
[01:30] THANKFUL YOU DON'T SEND SOMEONE TO KILL ME
[01:37] I LOVE YOU, I'M SORRY
[01:39] YOU WERE THE BEST BUT YOU WERE THE WORST
[01:41] AS SICK AS IT SOUNDS, I LOVED YOU FIRST
[01:44] I WAS A DICK, IT IS WHAT IT IS
[01:45] A HABIT TO KICK, THE AGE-OLD CURSE
[01:48] I TEND TO LAUGH WHENEVER I'M SAD
[01:50] I STARE AT THE CRASH, IT ACTUALLY WORKS
[01:52] MAKING AMENDS, THIS SHIT NEVER ENDS
[01:54] I'M WRONG AGAIN, WRONG AGAIN
[01:56] THE WAY LIFE GOES
[01:59] JOYRIDING DOWN OUR ROAD
[02:03] LAY ON THE HORN TO PROVE THAT IT HAUNTS ME
[02:10] I LOVE YOU, I'M SORRY
[02:12] YOU WERE THE BEST BUT YOU WERE THE WORST (THE WAY LIFE GOES)
[02:16] I WANNA SPEAK IN CODE
[02:20] HOPE THAT I DON'T, WON'T MAKE IT ABOUT ME
[02:26] I LOVE YOU, I'M SORRY
